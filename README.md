**ChickAge: Estimating the Age of Chickens Using Image Processing**


**Problem Description**

In the poultry industry, determining the accurate age of chickens is essential for managing feeding schedules, monitoring growth, and maintaining overall flock health. However, current methods often rely on manual observation, which is time-consuming, inconsistent, and dependent on human expertise. This lack of precision can lead to inefficiencies in farm management and affect production quality.

**Proposed Solution Overview**

To address this issue, we propose an intelligent application that estimates the age of chickens through image analysis. The system will utilize a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically extract and analyze visual features such as feather patterns, body size, and color changes from chicken images. By applying deep learning techniques, the application aims to deliver accurate, fast, and consistent age estimations, reducing human error and enhancing productivity in poultry operations.
